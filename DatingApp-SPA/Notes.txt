*Techinal notes*
    - to achieve security in password :- add salt to password before hashing takes place  .
    - salt is a random generated added to password before hashing 

Password -> hash -> hashed password  (using sha512)
=>it's easy to decyrept
but password +salt (random generated) - >hash -> hashed password 
=>it's not easy to decyrept because salt part is randomly generated every encyrption

* ngx bootstrap *
the best way to quickly integrate bootstarp 3 or 4 components with angular
npm install ngx-bootstrap --save
